## Binding notes

- **Read-only** — `tools:` excludes `Write` / `Edit`. The auditor produces findings; remediation is a separate write-enabled agent.
- **Cost choice** — Sonnet, not Opus. Upgrade the binding's `model:` line to Opus if a finding needs deep code-path analysis.
- **What the agent sees when invoked** — the canonical `security-auditor` role (identity, directives, constraints, rationalization table) plus this project's `CONTEXT.md` (stack, key paths, credential references). The binding itself is thin on purpose.
